# ii's Stupid Menu
A menu for Gorilla tag

# Why make your menu open-sourced?
I decided to make my project open-sourced primarily because I believe in the power of collaboration and sharing within the Gorilla Tag community. By making my menu open-sourced, I wanted to provide a platform where anyone could access and build upon my work. I am not concerned about who uses my code in their menu. I value the idea of fostering innovation and allowing others to benefit from the knowledge and effort I put into it. Open-sourcing the project also enables a diverse range of individuals to contribute, improve, and customize it to better suit their specific needs, which aligns with the spirit of open-source software development.
